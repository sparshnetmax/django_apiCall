NarrativeI want to be able to Authenticate via OAuth on Reddit.
I have an app that I'm creating and I need this functionality to make it easy for my user(s)
to login by just giving my app permission to authenticate with Reddit (attaching screenshot).
After authentication, I want to be able to keep the session valid (token refresh) since there
will be actions being done for the user even when they're not logged in (for example scheduling
a post). Of course the user also needs a valid auth session when they're performing actions
from my app and posting to Reddit.

Currently, users can perform all actions but I’m using the application type script in order
to connect with Reddit. This means I’m asking users to login credentials, secret code and etc
to use my app. The idea is to convert from script type authentication to application type
using OAuth. This conversion / integration will be done by me.


Assumptions
- This needs to be done in Django
- This is a stand alone app, I will integrate this solution to my current app
- Need documentation in the code to understand what’s being done
- Needs to work with Django Admin, I need to know who these users are
- A big feature is scheduling, which can happens off hours or when users is not currently using the app.
- There’s no UI, this app just needs to show that user is authenticated.
Scope
- User is able to authenticate by providing permission to their Reddit account by granting my app access.
- This is a simple 1 click “allow” action from Reddit
- Once permission is granted, user is redirected back to my app where they will not be allowed to use
- Only users that have granted permission to use Reddit OAuth through my app will be allowed to use it
- User session should be refreshed while using app
- User session should persist throughout app
- Session needs to be maintained if scheduled actions are performed when user is away, for example a
 schedule post
- User information should be available within Django Admin. Good to know which users have signed up and
 which are active (meaning OAuth with reddit is currently active)
- If users has revoked access to Reddit OAuth, then their access with my app is also revoked
Testing
- Ability to print out Reddit user attributes after they’re authenticated
- Ability to print out list of posts users has made
- Ability to see that user has revoked authentication with app
